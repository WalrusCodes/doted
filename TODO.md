Rough breakdown of next steps / tasks.

* [ ] *MVP: We Got Holes*
  * [ ] import an image (file picker)
    * [ ] display image
  * [ ] points:
      * [ ] add
      * [ ] move
      * [ ] delete
  * [ ] export points to an SVG file
* [ ] *We Got Lines*
  * [ ] allow connecting any two points with a line
  * [ ] pick color for line
  * [ ] pick thickness for line
  * [ ] delete lines
  * [ ] edit color/thickness for existing lines?
  * [ ] draw lines in output file
* [ ] *We Got Files*
  * [ ] save points (& lines) to a file (JSON?)
  * [ ] embed the imported image?
  * [ ] load points (& lines) + image

Ideas for later:

* Fancier stitches, not just straight lines
