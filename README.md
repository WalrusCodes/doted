# DotEd

DotEd (Dot Editor) is a simple webapp that lets you create patterns for
embroidering. You provide a background image that can be used as a guide. Then
you create dots (holes) and stitches between them. DotEd then generates an SVG
file that can be used to lasercut or 3D print a template.

This is a work in progress, and isn't really usable yet.
