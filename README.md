# DotEd

DotEd (Dot Editor) is a simple webapp that lets you create patterns for
embroidering. You provide a background image that can be used as a guide. Then
you create dots (holes) and stitches between them. DotEd then generates an SVG
file that can be used to lasercut or 3D print a template.

## Building and Running

* `npm start` - run in dev mode, open
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* `npm run build` - build the app for production in the `build` folder
